# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Jarne Aerts

ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m a third-year student at KdG, majoring in Data & AI. My work revolves around transforming raw data into actionable insights and creating innovative solutions that make data both accessible and impactful.

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m passionate about the entire data journeyâ€”from engineering robust pipelines to building machine learning models that bring data to life. I thrive on challenges like optimizing workflows, designing scalable systems, and uncovering the stories hidden within data.

ðŸš€ My interests span data engineering, machine learning, and leveraging automation to solve real-world problems. Whether it's architecting efficient data systems or experimenting with AI-driven solutions, Iâ€™m always eager to learn and push the boundaries of what's possible.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore my projects, and donâ€™t hesitate to connect if you want to collaborate or chat about all things data.
